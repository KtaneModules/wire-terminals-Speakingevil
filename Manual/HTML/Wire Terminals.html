                <h2>On the Subject of Wire Terminals</h2>
                <p class="flavour-text">If wires are the lifeblood of electronics, we may need to call in a neurosurgeon.</p>
            <ul><li>This module consists of a network of terminals, each with an LED and up to eight coloured wires connecting it to its neighbours.</li>
            <li>The colour of the LED denotes which wires connected to its terminal are live and should not be cut.</li>
            <li>Use the list below to assign a pair of wire colours to an LED colour:
            <ol><li>Take the first numeric digit of the serial number and assign its corresponding pair to the Red LED.</li>
            <li>Take the second numeric digit of the serial number and move down the list that many spaces, wrapping around from bottom to top.<br>
            If the space landed on is already assigned to another LED colour, continue moving down to the first unassigned space.</li>
            <li>Repeat the previous step to assign the LED colours Yellow, Blue, White, and Black, in that order.</ol></li></ul>
            <table>
            <tr><th>0</th><th>White &amp; Black</th></tr>
            <tr><th>1</th><th>Yellow &amp; Blue</th></tr>
            <tr><th>2</th><th>Red &amp; Black</th></tr>
            <tr><th>3</th><th>Yellow &amp; White</th></tr>
            <tr><th>4</th><th>Red &amp; Blue</th></tr>
            <tr><th>5</th><th>Yellow &amp; Black</th></tr>
            <tr><th>6</th><th>Blue &amp; White</th></tr>
            <tr><th>7</th><th>Red &amp; Yellow</th></tr>
            <tr><th>8</th><th>Blue &amp; Black</th></tr>
            <tr><th>9</th><th>Red &amp; White</th></tr>
            </table>
            <ul><li>If cutting a wire would result in partitioning the network into two disconnected groups, that wire is always live regardless of the states of the terminals it connects to.</li>
            <li>Once only live wires remain uncut, the colours of the LEDs will change.</li>
            <li>The module is solved when the only remaining uncut wires are always live.</li></ul>
